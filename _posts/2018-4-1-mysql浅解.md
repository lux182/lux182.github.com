MySQL 中经常出现 read committed，read repeatable,大部分的解释根本让人一头雾水，最好的了解还是亲自动手实验。

形如：
``` javascript
start transaction;
do something
commit;
```

我们用mysql无非就是两种方式，一种是写，一种是读。

对于写，如果用innodb，是有行级锁的，也就是说，当一个事务在写一行记录，另外的事务是不能写此行的。

对于读，read committed和read repeatable，两者都不可以读到别的事务未提交的数据.

这两者其实是一种隔离级别。当使用read committed，就保证只能读到已提交的数据。

使用repeatable保证了，读取到的数据不允许别人修改，例如select * from table where id=1, id为1的数据不能修改，
select * from table ,table 里的数据都不让修改。但是可以添加新的数据。

``` javascript
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM T;
WAITFOR DELAY '00:01:00'
SELECT * FROM T;
COMMIT;
```

read committed:第二个select可以返回任何数据。

read repeatable:第二个select能看见第一个select一样的数据（因为第一个select锁定了所选择的行），同时可能得到新增加的数据。

read serializable：第二个select保证能得到和第一个select完全一样的数据。

引用：
``` javascript
Read committed is an isolation level that guarantees that any data read was committed at the moment is read. It simply restricts the reader from seeing any intermediate, uncommitted, 'dirty' read. IT makes no promise whatsoever that if the transaction re-issues the read, will find the Same data, data is free to change after it was read.

Repeatable read is a higher isolation level, that in addition to the guarantees of the read committed level, it also guarantees that any data read cannot change, if the transaction reads the same data again, it will find the previously read data in place, unchanged, and available to read.

The next isolation level, serializable, makes an even stronger guarantee: in addition to everything repeatable read guarantees, it also guarantees that no new data can be seen by a subsequent read.

Say you have a table T with a column C with one row in it, say it has the value '1'. And consider you have a simple task like following:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM T;
WAITFOR DELAY '00:01:00'
SELECT * FROM T;
COMMIT;
That is a simple task that issue two reads from table T, with a delay of 1 minute between them.

under READ COMITTED, the second SELECT may return any data. A concurrent transaction may update the record, delete it, insert new records. The second select will always see the new data.
under REPEATABLE READ the second SELECT is guaranteed to see the rows that has seen at first select unchanged. New rows may be added by a concurrent transaction in that one minute, but the existing rows cannot be deleted nor changed.
under SERIALIZABLE reads the second select is guaranteed to see exactly the same rows as the first. No row can change, nor deleted, nor new rows could be inserted by a concurrent transaction.
If you follow the logic above you can quickly realize that SERIALIZABLE transactions, while they may make life easy for you, are always completely blocking every possible concurrent operation, since they require than nobody can modify, delete nor insert any row. The default transaction isolationlevel of the .Net System.Transactions scope is serializable, and this usually explains the abysmal performance that results.

And finally, there is also the SNAPSHOT isolation level. SNAPSHOT isolation level makes the same guarantees as serializable, but not by requiring that no concurrent transaction can modify the data, but by making every reader see it's own version of the world (it's own 'snapshot'). This makes it very easy to program against, very scalable as it does not block concurrent updates, but of course it has a price, and the price is extra server resource consumption.
